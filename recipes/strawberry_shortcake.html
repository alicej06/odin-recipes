    <p>Delicious strawberry shortcake!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>2/3 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 cups fresh strawberries, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the milk and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently a few times. Pat the dough into a 1-inch thick rectangle and cut out rounds using a biscuit cutter.</li>
        <li>Place the rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>While the shortcakes are baking, prepare the strawberries. In a bowl, combine the sliced strawberries and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Let them macerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>To assemble the strawberry shortcakes, slice the cooled shortcakes in half horizontally. Spoon some of the macerated strawberries onto the bottom half, followed by a generous dollop of whipped cream. Place the top half of the shortcake on top and add more strawberries and whipped cream if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade strawberry shortcake!</li>
