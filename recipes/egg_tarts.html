        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and powdered sugar. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolk and cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into circles to fit your tart pans. Press the dough into the pans and trim any excess.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk and heavy cream until just simmering. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until well combined. Gradually pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard filling into the prepared tart shells.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool before serving. Enjoy your homemade egg tarts!</li>
